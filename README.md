## Stable Links

Besides downloading the whole export as a single `.zip` file, you can also download individual files.

These are provided as `csv.gz` files and are e.g., useful for scripting purposes. For example, the URL `https://github.com/HowTheyVote/data/releases/latest/votes.csv.gz` will always link to the latest available `Votes` CSV.

We also provide a file called `export_timestamp_utc.txt`, in which the creation time of the export in UTC is stored.
